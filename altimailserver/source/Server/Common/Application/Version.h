/*VERSION README (IMPORTANT):

We use semantic versioning. The components are [Major].[Minor].[Revision].[Build] where
[Major] = New and BREAKING changes.
[Minor] = New features not vital to the operation including any bug fixes. Could be new features tested without any massive issues.
[Revision] = Used AFTER a release was published. Incremental build number to indicate the after-release build number.
[Build] = YYMM.BUILD_NO where BUILD_NO is incremental for each build and independent of [Revision].
e.g. 6.1.2.2506 => Major = 6, Minor = 1, Revision = 2 (2nd build after release), Build = 2506 (June 2025)
